<h2><a href="http://oskar.marytal.com/" target="_blank">One Page Website</a></h2>I made a website for a friend who wanted a place to display pictures of his welding projects, using Ruby on Rails and Knockout. This time I used Knockout to make a working lighbox instead of changing the lightbox's class from "visible" to "invisible". It was both more and less difficult.<br /><br /><i>More difficult because:</i><br />I accidentally included an outdated knockout gem which produced a few errors that I just couldn't figure out. I also didn't know about Knockout's $parent and $child bindings until after I had figured out a convoluted way of producing the same effect on my own.<br /><i><br /></i><i>Less difficult because:</i><br />Knockout's 'foreach' and 'click' bindings allowed me to easily move from image to image. I would say the overall time this took me, even with the difficulties, was less than the previous implementation of the same lightbox.<br /><br /><br />

If he wants to add images my friend, the welder, can go to a secret URL. There he has the option to either upload an image from his computer or provide an image url.

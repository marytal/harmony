Visit game <a href="http://github.marytal.com/rings/ring.html" target="_blank">HERE</a><br />See Github <a href="https://github.com/marytal/marytal.github.io/tree/master/rings" target="_blank">HERE</a><br /><span style="color: blue;"><br /></span><span style="color: blue;">Lessons Learned:</span><br /><span style="color: blue;">1. Google analytics tracking</span><br /><span style="color: blue;">2. Custom shapes with KineticJS</span><br /><br />Problems with program:<br />1.When the mouse is moved quickly past the rings, the program doesn't register that it had intersected with it. This makes cheating very easy.<br />2. Since each level is randomly generated, it is possible for a level to be impossible.<br />3. When the screen size is small enough, the Next Level button can be made to be right next to the star which, again, makes cheating possible.<br /><br />Problem Fixes:<br />1. Register the mouse movement as a line instead of a point and check if the line intersects with the ring.<br />2. Set up safeguards regulating how close rings can be to one another.<br />3. Enable the size of the star, the player, and the radiuses of the rings to take into account the screen size.<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://github.marytal.com/rings/ring.html" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-9yzp4E5xeEQ/VIYpWyPBE1I/AAAAAAAAAvQ/0Ahaf3Zho8I/s1600/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-03%2Bat%2B9.14.11%2BPM.png" height="590" width="640" /></a></div><br />

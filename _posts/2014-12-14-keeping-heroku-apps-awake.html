<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
I host my Rails apps on <a href="https://www.heroku.com/" target="_blank">Heroku</a>, which is an awesome service.<br />
It was becoming a problem though, that after an hour of disuse the apps would go into idle mode. Once an app is idling, the startup time ranges from 8 - 15 seconds, by which point many users just give up and click elsewhere.<br />
<br />
I fixed this by creating yet another Rails app and writting a custom rake task that sends GET requests to all of my previous applications, keeping them from idling.<br /> 

{% highlight ruby %}
desc "This task is called by the Heroku scheduler add-on"
task :send_requests => :environment do
  urls = ['http://loggit.marytal.com', 'http://oskar.marytal.com', 'http://magnetboard.marytal.com'] # etc.
  urls.each do |url| 
    HTTParty.get(url);
  end
end
{% endhighlight %}


To periodically schedule these requests, I installed a Heroku add-on called <a href="https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/scheduler#installing-the-add-on" target="_blank">Scheduler</a>. All I had to do then was specify which rake task to run and at what frequency. Problem solved!

Side Note: If you schedule too many tasks, Heroku will start charging you - so take care to monitor your usage.

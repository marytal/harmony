### About

Hi! I’m a student at the University of Waterloo, minoring in Computer Science. That’s right, CS is my minor, my major is Psychology. My mom wanted me to have a creative job, so she nudged me into the arts. Wrong move, mamma. Programming's where the creativity's at. The world is my digital oyster now. 

If you're looking to hire a summer intern, check out my [resume]({{ site.url }}/assets/resume.pdf) and [projects]({{ site.url}}/projects).

And for some non-CS stuff about me...

###### Travel
I spent this fall traveling. One month in Texas, two in Mexico. If you’re looking for a cheap and warm place to spend your winter vacay, look no further! You can read all about my adventures and eating frenzies in my [blog](http://marytal.com). 

###### Painting
[My mom is a talented artist](http://felicity-art.com), so we've always had canvases (not the HTML kind… ha) and paint laying around the house. I've taken to painting when I feel stressed or am trying to get out of doing chores.

###### Languages

As well as English, I speak Russian and Spanish. My parents, born and raised in the Soviet Union, deserve the credit for my spoken Russian since they refuse to argue in any other language. However, I will take credit for my reading skills, as I've been working to improve them since an embarrasing attempt to read to my little sister put me to shame. I've also been learning Spanish for a year now. I finished the [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/Marytal) course and have moved on to watching Mexican movies and shows.

### About


{% img about_image /assets/css/images/self.png Me! %}

Hi! I’m a student at the University of Waterloo, minoring in Computer Science. That’s right, CS is my minor, my major is Psychology. My mom wanted me to have a creative job, so she nudged me into the arts. Wrong move, mamma. Programming's where the creativity's at. The world is my digital oyster now. 

If you're looking to hire a summer intern, check out my [resume]({{ site.url }}/assets/resume.pdf) and [projects]({{ site.url}}/projects).


And for some non-CS stuff about me...

###### Travel
I've been to the Netherlands, Bulgaria, Luxumburg, Israel, etc. I'm so cultured that if I were born milk, I'd be yogurt by now. That was a joke. The only place where I expect to "find myself" is in a mirror, traveling is just a means to see cool places and eat great food. 

I kept a [travelogue](http://marytal.com) during my trip to Mexico, if you'd care to read it. 

###### Painting
[My mom is an artist](http://felicity-art.com), so we've always had canvases (not the HTML kind… ha) and paint laying around the house. I've taken to painting when I feel stressed or am trying to get out of cleaning.

###### Languages

As well as English, I speak Russian and Spanish. My parents deserve the credit for my spoken Russian since they refuse to argue with me in any other language. However, I will take credit for my reading skills, as I've been working to improve them since an embarrasing attempt to read to my little sister put me to shame. I've also been learning Spanish for a year now. I finished the [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/Marytal) course and have moved on to watching Spanish Soaps. [Those are fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WckCw_-7e3M).

I also enjoy [video editing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSVkHFJ0Ceo&feature=youtu.be), juggling, [watching movies](http://loggit.marytal.com/users/1), [babysitting my little sister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKBhxvfAzGk), waiting in super long lines, and doing my taxes. And that's about it! If you have any questions you can send me an email at <b>mary-briskin@hotmail.com</b>
